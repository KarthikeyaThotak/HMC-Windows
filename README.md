I have seen this [YouTube](https://youtu.be/-R_2JtpSx4A?si=BrFB0I43KL136kvF&t=112) video, where these Cybersecurity experts create an application that creates a dialog box indicating that your webcam is overheating please remove the webcam. The goal is to get the scammer's camera open.

- Able to access the backdoor through WAN

    - If the Webcam is closed by an Tape or something...The slave program has an ML algorithm to detech face in order to stop the window's error message popping 
      up.
